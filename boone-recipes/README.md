# React Frontend

The frontend of this website uses React, written in Typescript.

It was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`react-bootstrap` and `fontawesome` icons were used for the theme.

To install and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boonepeter/some-recipes
cd boone-recipes/boone-recipes
npm start
```

To build for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then copy build folder to the root directory of the backend.
